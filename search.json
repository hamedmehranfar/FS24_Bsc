    "text": "General\nThe work to be done in this thesis is part of the practical training in the field of infrastructure management of the Institute of Construction and Infrastructure Management and serves as preparation for the students for their future working career. Through the realization of this project it is expected that the students will gain experience with:\n\nthe handling of real world problems related to their field of study,\nthe application of an appropriate procedure and methodology to solve the given problem,\nthe preparation of a clear and structured presentation of the concepts and results,\nthe development of an independent understanding of the project and creative solutions and ideas.\n\n\n\nProblem statement\nProper management of infrastructure requires forecasting the condition of infrastructure assets and the level of funding required to ensure that they provide an adequate level of service, with due consideration of the associated uncertainties. In this project, you will make these estimates for the railway infrastructure network of the SZU. You will estimate how the condition of the existing network will change over the next 50 years, propose possible infrastructure interventions to maintain an adequate level of service, and estimate the cost of these interventions. In this project you will learn to:\n\nOrganize the available data of an infrastructure network,\nEvaluate the impact of individual objects on the overall level of service,\nDevelop models for the condition of individual objects, as well as how they change over time, and\nDevelop and evaluate interventions for infrastructure networks considering data uncertainty.\n\nIn this platform we upload the slides related to each weekly meeting.\n—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine objective function and classify assets\n\n\nEstimation of financial needs and condition of infrastructure assets\n\n\n\ntask1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 4, 2024\n\n\nHamed Mehranfar, Jushu An\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
