    "text": "Problem statement\nProper management of infrastructure requires forecasting the condition of infrastructure assets and the level of funding required to ensure that they provide an adequate level of service, with due consideration of the associated uncertainties. In this project, you will make these estimates for the railway infrastructure network of the SZU. You will estimate how the condition of the existing network will change over the next 50 years, propose possible infrastructure interventions to maintain an adequate level of service, and estimate the cost of these interventions. In this project you will learn to:\n\nOrganize the available data of an infrastructure network,\nEvaluate the impact of individual objects on the overall level of service,\nDevelop models for the condition of individual objects, as well as how they change over time, and\nDevelop and evaluate interventions for infrastructure networks considering data uncertainty.\n\nHere we upload the slides related to each weekly meeting according to the Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngantt\n    title Thesis timeline\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD\n    section Initialisation\n    Kick-off meeting : milestone, a1, 2024-02-26, 1d\n    \n    section Work in progress\n    Determine objective functions and classify assets :done a1, 2024-03-05,5d\n    Define condition classes and model deterioration : 6d\n    Determine possible interventions & strategies : 12d\n    Estimate cost of interventions and their impacts : 12d\n    Interim presentation :crit, 2024-04-08, 1d\n    Determine optimal interventioin strategy : 14d\n    Develop intervention program : 21d\n    Review results and any assumptions : 14d\n    Final presentation :crit, 2024-05-27, 1d\n    \n    section Finalisation\n    Document work incl. meeting minutes, final report, etc. :active a2,  2024-03-04, 12w\n    Material submission : milestone, 2024-05-31, 1d\n    \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The timeline for accomplishing the thesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine objective function and classify assets\n\n\nEstimation of financial needs and condition of infrastructure assets\n\n\n\nWeek2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMar 5, 2024\n\n\nHamed Mehranfar, Yushu An\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
